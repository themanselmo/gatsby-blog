So you want to write your own CRUD functionality in JavaScript? Well this is the right place to be!
But first off, what the heck is CRUD?

**CRUD** stands for:
**C**reate - **R**ead - **U**pdate - **D**elete

These are the four cardinal functions used when interacting with a database or dealing with data in general, and to use that functionality in JavaScript, we're going to use something called `fetch` to make a http request.

`fetch` is a built in JavaScript function that is not compatible with older browsers, but works very well with the modern browsers that do support it.

`fetch` takes in an *address* where the http request should be sent to, and optionally takes in *options* (method, headers, body, etc) and returns a promise (the container that our fetch response is in).

The most basic fetch request is a **Get** request. This is an example of our **Read** crud functionality.

Here is how we will set up our get request using fetch:
```
const whereWeWantToFetch = "url"
fetch(whereWeWantToFetch)
.then(res => res.json())
.then(data => console.log(data))
```
When no `method` is included, and the only argument passed to `fetch` is the url, the default operation will be a **Get** request.

The *url* is going to be where we are fetching to, where our database is.
We *then* convert our promise returned from our fetch to usable json, and finally *then* take our **data** and do whatever we want with it! (Although here we simply console.log it)

The next example request is a **Post** request. This is an example of our **Create** crud functionality.
Here is how we will set up our post request:
```
const whatIWantToPost = "Post me!"
const whereWeWantToFetch = "url"
fetch(whereWeWantToFetch, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(whatIWantToPost)
})
.then(res => res.json())
.then(data => console.log(data))
```
Notice the post requires a few extra bits compared to our get request. Here we need to include a *method* (what we are doing, here we are POSTing), *headers* (letting the server know what type of data to expect from the post request), and a *body* (what we are sending in the post request)

The third example request is a **Patch** request. This is an example of our **Update** crud functionality.
Here is how we will set up our Patch request:
```
const itemToUpdate = {...}
const whereWeWantToFetch = "url/${itemToUpdate.id}"
fetch(whereWeWantToFetch, {
    method: "PATCH",
    headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        key: "updatedValue"
    })
})
.then(res => res.json())
.then(data => console.log(data))
```
The patch request is similar to post, however here we are updating an existing item in our database.
Notice here we have to include an **id** at the end of our url to specify which item in our database we would like to update.

The final and relatively simple request is our **Delete** request, completing our CRUD acronym.
```
const itemToDelete = {...}
const whereWeWantToFetch = "url/${itemToDelete.id}"
fetch(whereWeWantToFetch, {
    method: "DELETE"
})
```
Delete requires no headers or body, only a method, as it is just removing something from our database.

... and with that, you now have all the basics to implement CRUD functions into your JavaScript application!
